So, with the caveat that I live uptown, and that's a bias in my lists (and this list is manhattan-only), here's a list!

All views my own, not paid for any of these.

Harlem (Food):

1) The Jerk House (Jamaican carryout) -- Adam Clayton Powell & 127th
2) Melba (soul food) Frederick Douglass & 114th
3) Rosa Pizza (Frederick Douglass & 119th)
4) Pizza Stop (Frederick Douglass & 119th; Lenox & 139th)
5) Manna (Soul Food, steam table) -- Frederick Douglass and 127th. Good soul food, by the pound. 
6) Jacob's (Soul food, steam table) -- Malcolm X and 129th. Another by the pound soul food place.
7) 1-stop Patty Shop (Jamaican) -- Amsterdam & 145th. Jamaican patties, several veg options. Reasonably priced, served hot.

Bakeries (Harlem):

1) LA Sweets NY -- Malcolm X & 120th. Huge cake slices; I'd recommend
the red velvet, the cheesecake, or the red velvet cheesecake, but make 
sure to call ahead
2) Lee Lee's -- Frederick Douglass & 118(9)th? Known for their rugelach
3) Sweet Chef Southern Style Bakery -- Hamilton place & 143rd. Really good rugelach. relatively little sugar in their pies, if that's your thing

East Harlem:

1) Taco Mix (Mexican) -- 116th. Good overall, and a nice selection of vegetarian options
2) Capy (Bakery) -- 116th. Local chain, known for their varieties of tres leches cakes


Washington Heights
5 Estrella -- 161st and Broadway, 141st(?) and Broadway. Crispy, flaky empanadas, and dulce de leche cheesecake
Blue Corn -- 158th and Amsterdam. Mexican. Good, solid, consistent. 


Morningside Heights:

1) Banh (Vietnamese) -- Amsterdam and 107th
2) Doaba Deli (Indian, vegetarian) -- Amsterdam and 107th
3) Absolute Bagels (...) -- Broadway & 106th(?) Cash only
4) Malaysian Grill (Malaysian) -- Broadway & 104th. Big portions, cheap, delicious.

UWS (not exhaustive):

1) Maison Pickle (French/New American) -- Broadway and 84th. Delicious, huge portions, relatively reasonably priced. I recommend brunch. The breads they offer are really good.
2) Parm (Italian American) -- Columbus & 71st
3) Magnolia (bakery) -- known for their banana pudding (skip the cupcakes)
4) Saiguette (Vietamese) -- My favorite Vietnamese place. No sit-down; but you
can walk to Central Park, two blocks away, and eat
5) Baazi (Indian) -- Fancy Indian food. Very good, veg options. Skip the veg biryani, but the meat biryani is good.

Midtown:

Ace's Pizza -- Rockefeller Center. Detroit-style, no place to eat there, but I recommend sitting at the fountains on a nice day.
2) Breads Bakery (Bakery) -- Get the babka. Rockefeller center 

Downtown (I get down here less often):

1) B&H dairy (jewish deli, dairy kosher) -- 2nd ave & 8th. probably my favorite
deli in NYC; no meat, but they do have fish (lox, whitefish, etc).
2) Breads Bakery (Bakery) -- Get the babka. Union Sq and 16th 
3) Lions & Tigers & Squares -- 8th and 23rd. Detroit-style Pizza

Koreatown:

1)  Hong Chun Cheon Dak Galbi -- a big platter served family style
(chicken, kimchi, Tteokbokki). On the second floor
2)  Grace Street Coffee & Desserts -- I recommend the Burnt Basque cheesecake
3) bb.q Chicken -- Korean fried chicken. You can pick up a box, and either eat 
it there, or go outside to Bryant Park and eat it and peoplewatch.

For an "NYC Steakhouse":

1. Keene's (W 36th and 6th). It's a steakhouse, it's really good. Known for 
their mutton, which I recommend. You'll need a reservation.
2. Le Marais (W 46, between 6th and 7th). Kosher steakhouse, really good. Also, good non-steak options if someone doesn't want beef. You'll need a reservation.


For old-school, overstuffed deli sandwiches:

1. 2nd avenue deli (E. 33rd and 3rd Ave). Meat kosher deli, best corned beef
in the city. Also, get the matzo ball soup. There can be a wait, and they only
do walk-ins.
2. Pastrami Queen (72nd and Broadway). Not sure if it's officially kosher, but if you want Jewish deli on the UWS, they're pretty good.
