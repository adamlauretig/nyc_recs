So, with the caveat that I live uptown, and that's a bias in my lists (and this list is manhattan-only), here's a list!

All views my own, not paid for any of these.

Harlem (Food):

1) The Jerk House (Jamaican carryout) -- Adam Clayton Powell & 127th
2) Melba (soul food -- probably the best iteration around here)
Frederick Douglass & 114th
3) Clove (Indian) -- Amsterdam and ~137th
4) El Porton (Mexican, little bit of a hike) -- Broadway and 123rd
5) Rosa Pizza (Frederick Douglass & 119th)
6) Pizza Stop (Frederick Douglass & 119th; Lenox & 139th)

Bakeries (Harlem):
1) LA Sweets NY -- Malcolm X & 120th. Huge cake slices; I'd recommend
the red velvet, the cheesecake or the red velvet cheesecake, but make 
sure to call ahead
2) Lee Lee's -- Frederick Douglass & 118(9)th? Known for their rugelach
3) Sweet Chef Southern Style Bakery -- Hamilton place & 143rd. Really good rugelach. relatively little sugar in their pies, if that's your thing


Morningside Heights:

1) Banh (Vietnamese) -- Amsterdam and 107th
2) Doaba Deli (Indian, vegetarian) -- Amsterdam and 107th
3) Absolute Bagels (...) -- Broadway & 106th(?) Cash only

UWS (not exhaustive):

1) Parm (Italian American) -- Columbus & 71st
2) Magnolia (bakery) -- known for their banana pudding (skip the cupcakes)
3) Saiguette (Vietamese) -- My favorite Vietnamese place. No sit-down; but you
can walk to Central Park, two blocks away, and eat

Downtown (I get down here less often):
1) B&H dairy (jewish deli, dairy kosher) -- 2nd ave & 8th. probably my favorite
deli in NYC; no meat, but they do have fish (lox, whitefish, etc).
2) Breads Bakery (Bakery) -- Get the babka. Union Sq and 16th 
3) Lions & Tigers & Squares -- 8th and 23rd. Detroit-style Pizza

Koreatown:
1)  Hong Chun Cheon Dak Galbi -- a big platter served family style
(chicken, kimchi, Tteokbokki). On the second floor
2)  Grace Street Coffee & Desserts -- I recommend the Burnt Basque cheesecake
3) bb.q Chicken -- Korean fried chicken. You can pick up a box, and either eat 
it there, or go outside to Bryant Park and eat it and peoplewatch.

For an "NYC Steakhouse":
1. Keene's (W 36th and 6th). It's a steakhouse, it's really good. Known for 
their mutton, which I recommend. You'll need a reservation.

For old-school, overstuffed deli sandwiches:
1. 2nd avenue deli (E. 33rd and 3rd Ave). Meat kosher deli, best corned beef
in the city. Also, get the matzo ball soup. There can be a wait, and they only
do walk-ins.
